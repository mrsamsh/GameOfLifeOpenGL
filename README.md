# GameOfLifeOpenGL
This is another iteration of game of life, this time using c++ and OpenGL.
## Difference
OpenGL is way faster that using SDL2 library, as it is rendering a large
number of rects rather than rendering them individually.
## Dependencies
GLFW is needed.
## To build
```c++
make run
```
